        <p className="mb-8">
          My path to software engineering was anything but linear. Starting off
          with a degree from UCL, I became a Chartered Engineer and project
          manager in civil engineering, accumulating over 7 years of experience.
          However, my passion shifted to software engineering, moving away from
          managing big construction projects. My early school days dabbling in
          Pascal, C, and Python, followed by intensive Bootcamp training, led me
          back to solving construction-related problems with new tech insights.{" "}

        <p className="mb-8">
          In the realm of software, my skill set is extensive. I excel in both
          frontend and backend development, showing particular expertise in
          TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, React, and Python. Additionally, I'm
          proficient in managing both SQL and NoSQL databases. I'm all about
          making sure every line of code I write not only works but works well
          and lasts.

          At the Keller Group, I’ve utilised these skills to enhance our
          projects and streamline operations. Yet, being a software engineer to
          me means more than coding; it's about mentoring junior engineers and
          contributing to their growth. Sharing knowledge, teaching, and
          coaching are as vital to me as building innovative software.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-8">
          When I'm not coding, I love to share what I’ve learned with people.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-8">
          I love good design, hiking camping, travel and music.
